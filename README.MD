# 🚀 Jaclang-Jaseci Experiments Repository

This repository is a collection of my experiments, tutorials, and projects written in **[Jac Language](https://jac-lang.org/)**.
The goal is to learn, explore, and demonstrate how Jac can be applied across domains ranging from **basic programming concepts** to **complex simulations and AI visualizations**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repo is continuously evolving. Here’s the current organization:

### 1. `jac_language/`

A series of beginner-friendly tutorials in Jac covering the basics:

* **file_structure/** – My first program in Jac, demonstrating:

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Jac
  * Core language syntax and control flow
  * Basic file/directory structure in Jac projects

### 2. `mars_simulation/`

A simulation of **life on Mars** built using Jac:

* Uses **nodes, walkers, and edges** to model interactions.
* Demonstrates how Jac can be applied to **agent-based simulations** and **systems modeling**.

### 3. `llm_visualizer/`

An educational tool for **visualizing Large Language Models (LLMs)**:

* Explains different LLM architectures.
* Interactive visualization of attention, token flows, and more.
* Great for students, researchers, and curious minds exploring deep learning.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

This repo will be regularly updated with new experiments:

* 🔜 More **Jac tutorials** (data structures, algorithms, concurrency)
* 🔜 Extended **Mars simulations** (ecosystems, colony management, resource flows)
* 🔜 Advanced **AI/ML projects** (Jac + LLM integration, interpretable AI tools)
* 🔜 Utility libraries and educational demos

---

## 💡 Purpose

* **For learners:** A practical guide to understand Jac programming.
* **For researchers & tinkerers:** A space to explore how Jac can model and orchestrate complex systems.
* **For myself:** A learning log as I dive deeper into Jac’s ecosystem.

## 🚧 Status

This project is **work in progress** and will grow as I add more tutorials, simulations, and visualizers. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome!
