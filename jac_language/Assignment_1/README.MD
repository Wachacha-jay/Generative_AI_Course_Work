I have created a comprehensive employee management system in Jac with a creative twist making it a space station crew management system! This will demonstrate proper separation of concerns and Jac's unique features.

**Space Station Crew Management System** in Jac! This creative employee program demonstrates proper software architecture with:

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

**Main Application (`main.jac`)**
- Entry point that creates crew members
- Demonstrates all system features
- Shows promotions, bonuses, and statistics

**Models (`models/`)**
- `employee.jac` - Interface definitions for Employee and CrewMember
- `employee.impl.jac` - Complete implementations with space-themed functionality
- `employee.test.jac` - Comprehensive unit tests

**Utilities (`utils/`)**
- `helpers.jac` - Helper functions for formatting, calculations, and reporting
- `constants.jac` - All configuration values, departments, ranks, and system settings

## âœ¨ Creative Features

- **Space Station Theme**: Employees are crew members on "ISS-Artemis Orbital Platform"
- **Rank System**: From Cadet to Captain with appropriate salary ranges
- **Mission Tracking**: Crew members complete missions and earn bonuses
- **Clearance Levels**: Security clearance progression
- **Department Structure**: 8 departments (Command, Engineering, Medical, etc.)
- **Performance Metrics**: Promotions, bonuses, and senior crew status
- **Emergency Protocols**: Each department has designated emergency stations

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Jac Language Features Demonstrated

- Object Spartial oriented design with interfaces
- Implementation separation (`:obj:Type:def:method`) and implementaion on the .impl file
- Proper imports between modules with the main entry to the program on the main
- Test structure- complete tests with jac special way of running tests jac test
- Global constants
- Type annotations
- Modern syntax with `let`, `has`, `def`

Run `main.jac` to see the full crew management system in action!
